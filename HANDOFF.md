# Handoff — UK Home Insurance Risk Map

**Written:** 2026-08-12 · lives in the repo from now on (supersedes the
old `%TEMP%\uk-risk-map-handoff.md`, which is now just a pointer here)
**Repo:** https://github.com/SMcode-source/uk-home-insurance-risk-map ·
**Live:** https://smcode-source.github.io/uk-home-insurance-risk-map/

## Status: complete, deployed, TWO resolutions published (2026-08-12)

The site now publishes the model at **two grains side by side**:
`/map.html` over 2,736 postcode districts and `/sectors.html` over
10,398 derived postcode sectors. One template builds both pages, so
they cannot drift; the layout suite runs every map invariant against
both. **71 tests**, CI green, Pages live.

Why it was worth doing: aggregated back to districts the sector model
reproduces the published one (0.965 correlation, level within 0.4%),
but **19% of districts hide sectors that differ by more than 2x** in
premium - worst CB8 at 8.1x (GBP 29 to GBP 237). A district price
charges both halves of a district the average of a risk only one half
has. The splits are physical: a river through half a district, a clay
boundary under the other.

That work also turned up a real bug in the exposure weights - homes
apportioned to postcodes that no longer exist - now fixed in both
models; see below. Nothing is half-finished and nothing is waiting on
anyone. The list at the bottom is what is *blocked or optional*, not
work in progress.

## Previously (2026-08-10): the model's gust source changed

**The gust component runs on Met Office MIDAS station
observations**, not ERA5 reanalysis — the first
model change since `a1cacd0`, user-approved on priced evidence
(commit `de19471`, published by Actions run 15). Everything else from
the 2026-08-08 pick-up list also landed: layout regression tests in CI,
the popup redesign, the 5 MB map page cut to 209 KB, a full keyboard
route through the map, and postcode-sector polygons derived for all of
GB from open data.

## What the model is now, in one paragraph

Five perils per postcode district from open hazard data, joined by a
5-dim C-vine (weather at the root). Four are insured — subsidence (BGS
bedrock blended with 625k superficial at `SUP_WEIGHT` 0.5), weather
(Met Office climatologies + a 1-in-50 gust Gumbel-fitted at **191 MIDAS
stations**, ≥20 years' coverage, ≤300 m altitude), flood (severity
conditioned on EA depth bands), groundwater — calibrated per peril to
ABI 2025 payouts, exposure-weighted by census households apportioned
across LIVE postcodes only, capital Euler-allocated from the portfolio,
premiums on TVaR₉₉. Coastal erosion is in the vine but deliberately
outside the premium. A climate scenario reprices on the EA's future
flood extents: **+10.5%** exposure-weighted over the 2,087 English
districts the EA models, worst DN32 (Grimsby) +200%. Exposure-weighted
premium **£59.07** over 27.26m households. All figures re-verified from
the committed output on 2026-08-12, after the gust swap and the
exposure fix.

## Fixed 2026-08-12: households were apportioned to DEAD postcodes

ONSPD retains terminated postcodes - **897,835 of 2,694,205 rows, 33%**
- and `fetch_households.py` spread LSOA household counts across all of
them, crediting roughly 730,000 homes to addresses that no longer
exist. Every exposure weight in the model was slightly wrong, and had
been from the start.

It surfaced only because of the sector build: a dead postcode has no
Code-Point centroid, so wholly-dead sectors got no polygon and 2.7% of
exposure had nowhere to land. That mismatch was the symptom; the
phantom homes were the disease, and they were in the district model
too.

Fixed by filtering on `doterm`, priced first on `exp/live-postcodes`
(now deleted) and then applied to both resolutions: premium level
**-0.25%**, **40 districts (1.5%) change rating group**, none by more
than one, movers concentrated in rural/remote districts with the most
postcode churn per live address. National total unchanged - LSOA
totals are fixed, only their apportionment moved. **The sector/district
exposure gap closed from -2.75% to -0.06%**, and the nesting test's
tolerance was tightened from 4% to 0.5% so phantom exposure cannot
creep back.

**Trap worth remembering:** `rebuild.yml` does NOT run
`fetch_households.py` - it reads the committed CSV. The first attempt
to price this patched only the fetcher, reproduced main byte-for-byte,
and looked exactly like "no impact". Regenerate and commit the CSV,
then dispatch.

## The experiment-branch pattern (how model decisions get made here)

Three times used, three times decisive — reuse it for any future model
input change:

1. branch `exp/<name>`, change ONE input, push;
2. `gh workflow run rebuild.yml --ref exp/<name> -f commit=false`
   (~8 min on a free runner);
3. `gh run download <id> --name model-output`, then
   `python scripts/compare_rebuild.py <artifact geojson>`;
4. put the numbers in front of the user; **the swap is their call**;
5. approved → apply on main, dispatch with `commit=true`, delete the
   branch. The published output is content-identical to the evidence
   artifact (byte-compare fails on CRLF checkout — known, not a drift).

Decisions taken this way, so far:

- **SUP_WEIGHT stays 0.5** (2026-08-08). Dose-response at 0.35/0.25 was
  linear with no cliff — premium level moves <0.3%, central London
  sub_score climbs back linearly. No empirical basis to move; the data
  cannot distinguish weights because 625k publishes no thickness.
- **ERA5 → MIDAS gusts, swapped** (2026-08-10). Premium level −0.36%,
  wx_score correlation 0.974, 28.8% of districts change group but only
  20 move ≥2; relativities shift toward measured coastal exposure
  (Fraserburgh/Blyth/Whitby/Norfolk up; SY23/SY25 −18%, Brighton −16%).
  Surface evidence: `scripts/compare_gust_surfaces.py`.
- **Terminated postcodes excluded from exposure** (2026-08-12). −0.25%
  premium, 40 districts (1.5%) change group, none by >1. Applied to
  BOTH resolutions in one landing so the two maps never disagreed about
  how many homes exist. Detail in the section above.

## Corrections since the last handoff — do not reintroduce

The full historical list lives in the previous handoff's sections and
the auto-memory; these are the NEW ones:

- **Stations above 300 m are excluded from the gust reduction.** The
  first MIDAS run's top extreme was Cairngorm summit (1,237 m, fitted
  rp50 283 km/h), IDW-smeared across valley districts. A summit
  anemometer measures a climate nobody lives in. Gate + selftest in
  `gusts_from_midas.py`.
- **The map's fetch URL must stay a literal in the fetch() call** — the
  asset test extracts quoted fetch arguments. And never put a quoted
  example of a guard-matched pattern in a shipped comment: a `'...'`
  placeholder in one was chased as a filename, "existed" on Windows
  (trailing dots vanish in path lookups) and failed on Linux CI.
- **The popupopen handler must be registered BEFORE the deep-link block**
  — the deep link opens a popup synchronously, so a handler attached
  after it never sees that popup. Deep-linked popups shipped un-dodged
  for two commits because of this.
- **Never measure Leaflet geometry mid-animation.** The keep-clear pass
  once ran during the deep link's zoom animation, measured the popup at
  x=−96, "fixed" it, and the final animation frame undid everything.
  `keepClearWhenSettled()` defers on `_animatingZoom`/`_panAnim`.
- **Esc restores focus in the keydown handler, not in popupclose** — the
  popup's DOM teardown is not synchronous with `closePopup()`, and a
  focus-fell-to-body check races it (and lost, in the tests).
- **Plain arrows in the popup are reserved for scrolling** its focusable
  content; district-walking is Ctrl/Alt+arrow. The search box acts on
  'change', never 'input' — district names nest (YO2 prefixes YO25).
- **flex-basis applies to HEIGHT once flex-direction flips to column** —
  the vine diagram's row proportions collapsed every stacked panel to
  zero height on phones until the media query reset them.
- **Never iterate a SET when writing a build artifact.** Python
  randomises string hashing per process, so the map assets' JSON keys
  came out in a different order every run: my build and CI's disagreed
  by construction and CI failed as "docs/ is stale" with an unreadable
  diff. `build_map.web_asset` sorts its columns; verified by building
  twice in separate processes and comparing md5.
- **A layer with no data is OMITTED, not drawn blank.** The sector map
  has no climate scenario (the EA extents were never re-rasterised at
  that resolution), and offering the layer would paint the country grey
  under a legend saying "not modelled — England only", which is a false
  statement about *why* it is empty. `OMIT_METRICS` in the template.
- **The EA WMS throttles GitHub runners like BGS does.** Surface water,
  depth and erosion all fetched fine from Actions over the 10,398
  sectors, but rivers/sea served ~3.5 h and then 403'd every request at
  any backoff. That one is a laptop job; the fetcher's refusal to write
  an incomplete result is what stopped it shipping a hole.

## Evidence tooling now in the repo

- `scripts/compare_rebuild.py` — experiment artifact vs published model
  (premium level, churn, movers). Both model decisions above used it.
- `scripts/compare_gust_surfaces.py` — two gust point sets IDW'd to
  district level through the model's own code path.
- `scripts/compare_sector_model.py` — sectors vs districts: aggregation
  consistency, within-district spread, and the widest-range districts.
  Defaults to the two published outputs; pass paths on the branch.
- `scripts/validate_sectors_scotland.py` — derived sectors vs NRS's
  official Scottish ones, reporting district-IoU beside sector-IoU so
  boundary-set disagreement is separated from the method's own error.
  Writes `data/sector_validation.json`, which the site injects.
- `scripts/derive_sectors.py` + `fetch_codepoint.py` — the sector
  geometry itself, from OS Code-Point Open.
- `tests/test_layout.py` — the browser-level invariants (Playwright;
  skips without it), run against BOTH map pages.
  `tests/test_midas.py` — the BADC-CSV selftest.

## Environment

The durable machine notes live in the auto-memory
(`uk-risk-map-environment`); headlines: this machine sleeps mid-run
(checkpoint everything, judge progress by log lines not wall-clock);
use the harness's own background runner, never `nohup`; `python -u`
plus a log file; PowerShell-from-bash quoting is a minefield (write a
script file); layout measurement needs Playwright or the live site,
never `file://`; CRLF makes checked-out files hash differently from
served ones; Windows silently strips trailing dots in path lookups, so
a path-existence test can pass here and fail on Linux CI.

MIDAS specifics: the 8.4 GB mirror sits in gitignored `data/midas/`
(refetch: `fetch_midas.py`, needs a fresh CEDA token in
`~/.ceda_token` — tokens live ~72 h and are never committed or
printed). `data/gusts_midas.csv` is committed; `fetch_gusts.py` (ERA5)
remains the no-account fallback and regenerates the pre-swap surface.

## What remains, honestly

- **The sector map has no climate scenario.** Everything else was
  re-aggregated over the 10,398 sectors; the EA's future flood extents
  were not, so that one layer is omitted there. Closing it means
  re-running `fetch_flood.py --climate`, `fetch_surface_water.py
  --climate` and `fetch_sw_depth.py --climate` at sector resolution -
  cloud-friendly except rivers/sea, which the EA 403s from runners.
- **Sector geometry is derived, not official**, and always will be for
  England & Wales. Measured cost: none beyond the district outlines it
  inherits (NRS Scotland, sector IoU 0.706 vs district IoU 0.689) - but
  those district outlines are themselves community approximations, and
  0.689 is now the number to quote for them.
- **A claims triangle** (data-sharing agreement with an insurer; not
  purchasable) unblocks fitting the copulas and frequency/severity from
  data — the single highest-value missing dataset.
- **PAF/AddressBase** (licensed, ££) unblocks sub-district exposure,
  sum insured and construction type.
- **BGS superficial thickness** (licensed) would make `SUP_WEIGHT`
  physical instead of a bounded prior.

Everything else that was ever on a pick-up list is done and live.

## No secrets in this repo

`gh` uses a keyring token; the CEDA token lives only in `~/.ceda_token`
(outside the repo, expired within days of use); nothing sensitive
appears in the code, data, workflows or this file.
